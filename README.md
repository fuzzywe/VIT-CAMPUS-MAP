## üìñ Overview

The **Campus Map** is a digital navigation tool designed as a mobile application to simplify campus exploration and enhance user experience. This project addresses the practical challenges of campus navigation and provides a comprehensive record of daily and weekly campus activities.

## üîç Scope of the Project

The goal is to develop a prototype for a University Campus Map that utilizes mobile mapping technologies (GPS, AR), GPS sensors, and campus-specific data integration. This application aids students, faculty, staff, and visitors in navigating the campus efficiently.

## üéØ User and Requirement Analysis

### Target Users

The target users for the Campus Map application primarily include:

- Students
- Faculty
- Staff
- Visitors navigating the campus

### Key Features

| **Feature**           | **Description**                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Route Guidance        | Provides users with directional cues for efficient navigation.                                   |
| Event Search          | Allows users to search for ongoing events on campus.                                             |
| New Venues            | Notifies users about new venues and points of interest on campus.                               |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations with Existing Design

- Inefficient navigation methods and reliance on campus maps for directions hinder seamless movement across the campus.
- Current maps may lack sufficient details about the places or services available on campus, leading to accessibility issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Design Changes

- Update the campus map to be compatible with modern design principles to ensure optimal layout, functionality, and performance.
- Integrate custom features such as indoor mapping using technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth for precise location services.
- Include user feedback mechanisms to improve user interaction and participation.

## üìà Prototype and Evaluation

The prototype has been evaluated based on user interaction and task completion success rates. The data was collected from campus community members, targeting users who navigate the campus regularly.

### Results

- The Front-end of the application was developed successfully, with numerous tasks found to be easier for users.
- Users were able to successfully complete their navigation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the application.
